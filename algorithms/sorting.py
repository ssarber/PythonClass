Insertion sort
Runtime complexity: iteration over array of length n and switching at most k pairs for each iteration (by definition of the given array), takes O(n â€¢ k).
If k is constant and relatively small we can argue that it's actually close to a linear O(n) case.

Space complexity: constant O(1), all we need is 2 indices.
